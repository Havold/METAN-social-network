## ⚠️ Important Notice
When you first clone the METAN application, you may encounter issues connecting to the database. This is a common setup step that requires some configuration:
- The application uses SQL Server as its database. To connect to the database, you'll need to modify the connection string (strCon) in the application’s configuration files.
- If you're unfamiliar with connecting to a SQL Server database, please refer to tutorials on YouTube. Search for "How to connect to SQL Server database in [your development environment]" for step-by-step guidance.
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- In this project, I use __C#__ and __Winform__ for development, SQL Server Management for data management.
